# Web App Perso - Mathieu Cowan
First web app created, conceptualized, and implemented by Mathieu Cowan.
This app is supposed to help user to make decision based on many factors. These decisions are only designed to be made for social gathering, to decide what you do of your evening/day on a entertainment level.

The first part of this project is exclusively for romantic activities. Friendly activities will then be implemented.

Concerning the first part, the first version will be composed of : 
The user, which can be created, edited, deleted, has the following attributes :
- ID information : *ID* for numeroting the persons in the database ; *firstname*, *name*, *sex*, *class* which can be "friend", "family" or "partner".
- now this is the most tricky part : *foodtypelist* with the list of types of food he/she likes, *restaulist* for her favorite list of restaurants, *drinkslist*, *cocktaillist*, *activitylist*, *sportlist*
